## 📌 Overview

Early detection of papaya leaf disease is critical for smallholder farmers in Bangladesh, who face **39.9% post-harvest losses** and widespread pesticide misuse. This work proposes **SwinGhost-ClustNet**, a hybrid deep ensemble that combines:

- 🔭 **Swin Transformer** — for capturing global context and long-range dependencies
- 👻 **GhostNet** — for efficient local texture feature extraction
- 🔗 **Cross-Attention Fusion** — for merging multi-scale feature representations
- 🔵 **K-Means Clustering (k=8)** — for pseudo-label generation to improve generalization with limited labeled data

The system also integrates a **Flask-based deployment API** providing real-time diagnostics and pesticide recommendations in Bengali, tailored for field use by smallholder farmers.

## 🏆 Key Results

| Metric        | Score     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Accuracy      | **99.25%** |
| Precision     | **99.28%** |
| Recall        | **99.25%** |
| F1-Score      | **99.25%** |
| ROC-AUC       | **1.000**  |

- Tested on **1,401 images** (held-out test set)
- **+2.10% improvement** over base models (ablation-validated)
- K-Means silhouette score: **0.67** (k=8)

## 🧠 Explainability (XAI)

To build farmer trust and ensure clinically meaningful predictions, three Grad-CAM-based visualization methods were applied:

| XAI Method   | IoU Score |
|--------------|-----------|
| Grad-CAM++   | **0.72**  |
| Layer-CAM    | **0.68**  |
| Grad-CAM     | **0.65**  |

These methods verify that model decisions are anchored to **disease-affected leaf areas** (lesions, webbing patterns), not spurious image artifacts.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The model was trained and evaluated on a curated dataset of **9,342 papaya leaf images** collected from **8 districts** of Bangladesh.

| Property        | Details                           |
